A landing page is a standalone web page created for a specific goal, such as promoting a product, service, or campaign. It is designed to capture visitors’ attention and encourage them to take a single action, like signing up or making a purchase. Unlike regular website pages, it has minimal distractions and focused content. Landing pages often include clear headlines, brief information, and strong call-to-action buttons. They are commonly used in digital marketing and advertising campaigns.
